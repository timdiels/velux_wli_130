measured with probe at 1x. It's such a tiny voltage that at 10x you can barely see the difference.

Blue draws 7.5 (10ohm resistor)  to 8.5mA (22ohm resistor) when driving the line to low. In idle it on average sends
current back.

Yellow/red idle at 33mV / 1.5mA then go up to 66mV / 3mA to recharge the capacitor it seems. During button press they
ramp up to 202mV / 9.2mA
