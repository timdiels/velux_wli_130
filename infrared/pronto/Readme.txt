Remote Control Codes for Velux Skylight
---------------------------------------

This ccf file contains one Device called "Skylight".  This contains two panels,
Skylight 1 and Skylight All.  Each panel is the same, except that Skylight one 
contains the codes only for group code 1 and skylight all contains the codes 
for group code "all".

All codes are for security code "1" (ie DIP switch 1 on, all other switches 
off).

The top and bottom arrows on each panel are "automatic" mode buttons - ie.
the motor moves until the limit of movement is reached or the stop button is
pressed.  The middle arrows are "manual" mode buttons - the motor only moves 
while the button is held down.

Note that the Velux controller will handle a sequence of commands, so you can
send a "motor 1" automatic down followed by a motor 2 automatic down and the 
controller will start the motor 2 down once the limit switch has triggered on
motor 1.
